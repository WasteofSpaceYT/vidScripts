# Learn Unity Platformer

## Introduction
Unity is a program that lets you make games. I kinda want to learn how to use it. To do this, I'm going to make a simple 2D platformer. I haven't thought too much about it so I'm going in with no idea or thought process.

## The Plan
I want it to have a few levels, a soundtrack, appealing art, and an easy-to-use gameplay.
